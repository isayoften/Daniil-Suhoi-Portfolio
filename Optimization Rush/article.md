Training large language models (LLMs) requires significant computational resources and time. However, by optimizing the training process, it's possible to cut costs, speed up development, and improve the model's overall performance. This guide offers a detailed exploration of various optimization strategies, covering everything from choosing the right model to refining the learning process.

## 0. Introduction to Data Types
Before diving into the intricacies of model training, let's briefly explore how numbers are represented in a computer and the different types of data representations available. This foundational knowledge is crucial for understanding memory consumption during model training.

### Int16/Int8/Int4
These are standard integer types. The range of values they can represent is given by \\([-2^{n-1}, 2^{n-1} - 1]\\)

A schematic representation of an Int16 bit layout can be shown as: 1 sign bit and 15 value bits.

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/WY7E6uMR73aigsfcsCq8H.png)

The more bits used, the larger the range of values that can be represented.

### Float32
In Float32, the bit layout is as follows: 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, and 23 mantissa bits.

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/KSS-oRLsPUnQ9Vypo7UZp.png)

The formula for the value is:
$$ v = (-1)^{\text{sign}} \cdot 2^{E-127} \cdot \left(1 + \sum_{i=1}^{23} b_{23-i}2^{-i}\right) $$

The key idea behind floating-point types is that more bits allocated to the exponent allow a wider range of values, while the bits allocated to the mantissa determine the precision within that range.

### Float16
The Float16 format uses 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, and 10 mantissa bits.

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/bX17lqakEY903HrSCZF-c.png)

The main drawback of Float16 is its limited range of values, with a maximum of 65504, making it prone to overflow in activation tensors.

### Bfloat16, –∏–ª–∏ brain float
Bfloat16 is a specialized data format developed by Google Brain. It can be considered an approximation of Float32. The bit layout is 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, and 7 mantissa bits..

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/jeGGZP2DxQfXZZuB72iRD.png)

Notice that the number of exponent bits is the same as in Float32, meaning bfloat16 can represent the same range of values, albeit with less precision. This reduces the risk of overflow in activation

Another advantage of bf16 is the ease of converting values to Float32. This is possible because of the similar bit layout. However, not all hardware currently supports this type, especially in mobile devices.

### TensorFloat32

TensorFloat32 is an interesting 19-bit data type introduced by NVidia, supported on architectures starting with NVidia Ampere (A-100). Its bit layout consists of 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, and 10 mantissa bits.

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/ha7W9jLH-O1BvMrG5cAQf.png)

Key features:
- The number of exponent bits matches bfloat16, and therefore Float32 as well.
- The number of mantissa bits matches Float16.

This results in an unusual but highly efficient and precise data type. It delivers excellent computational performance and is suitable for model training, although it's only available on modern NVidia GPUs.

### E4M3 –∏ E5M2
These are new 8-bit floating-point types introduced by NVidia, ARM, and Intel in the paper [FP8 Formats for Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05433).
The authors propose two possible 8-bit floating-point formats:
- E4M3: 1 sign bit, 4 exponent bits, and 3 mantissa bits.
- E5M2: 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, and 2 mantissa bits.

Experiments show that modern LLMs and image networks can be successfully trained and even inferred using these data types. We look forward to their broader adoption and hardware support. There are also more radical ideas for 4-bit floating-point formats, such as E2M1 and E3M0.

## [1. Where Did All the Memory Go?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054)

Let‚Äôs examine the memory consumption of the current training system. For example, a 1.5B parameter GPT-2 model requires 3GB (1.5B * 16bit) of memory for its weights (or parameters) in 16-bit precision, yet, it cannot be trained on a single GPU with 32GB memory using Tensorflow or PyTorch. One may wonder where all the memory goes. During model training, most of the memory is consumed by *model states*, i.e., tensors comprising of optimizer states, gradients, and parameters. Besides these model states, the rest of the memory is consumed by activations, temporary buffers and fragmented memory which we call *residual states*. We look at the memory consumption from both in details. 

![image/jpeg](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/As3IsTE-TuYbEWLHP_DoW.jpeg)

### 1.1 Model States: Optimizer States, Gradients and Parameters

Majority of the device memory is consumed by model states during training. Consider for instance, [Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980), one of the most popular optimizers for DL training. Adam requires storing two optimizer states, 1) the time averaged momentum and 2) variance of the gradients to compute the updates.

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/qvSg5entCT4Uk4BAOGsKW.png)

Therefore, to train a model with Adam, there has to be enough memory to hold a copy of both the momentum and variance of the gradients. In addition, there needs to be enough memory to store the gradients and the weights themselves. Of these three types of the parameter-related tensors, the optimizer states usually consume the most memory, specially when mixed-precision training is applied.

**Mixed-Precision Training** The state-of-the-art approach to train large models on the current generation of NVIDIA GPUs is via [mixed precision training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740), where parameters and activations are stored as fp16, enabling the use of the high throughput tensor core units on these GPUs. During mixed-precision training, both the forward and backward propagation are performed using fp16 weights and activations. However, to effectively compute and apply the updates at the end of the backward propagation, the mixed-precision optimizer keeps an fp32 copy of the parameters as well as an fp32 copy of all the other otimizer states.

![image/gif](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/QmMbZaLmppCKaIo0fWtHT.gif)

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/h0p-IciIv8sVY1I3l_wUL.png)

Let‚Äôs take Adam as a concrete example. Mixed precision training of a model with Œ¶ parameters using Adam requires enough memory to hold an fp16 copy of the parameters and the gradients, with memory requirements of 2Œ¶ and 2Œ¶ bytes respectively. In addition, it needs to hold the optimizer states: an fp32 copy of the parameters, momentum and variance, with memory requirements of 4Œ¶, 4Œ¶, and 4Œ¶ bytes, respectively.

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/zlD-T_HtyeSKEY_zhqLix.png)

In total, this results 16Œ¶ bytes of memory requirement. For a model such as GPT-2 with 1.5 Billion parameters, this leads to a memory requirement of at least 24 GB, which is significantly higher than the meager 3 GB of memory required to hold the fp16 parameters alone.

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/3DuZdDRbhLK46MfVhKJJX.png)

### 1.2 Residual Memory Consumption
**Activations** can take up a significant amount of memory during training. As a concrete example, the 1.5B parameter GPT-2 model trained with sequence length of 1K and batch size of 32 requires about 60 GB of memory. 

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/iuytzmuBVVrIPUb72hj3s.png)

![image/gif](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/GgNu3RrWs0ls9AX3jFUmk.gif)

The activation memory of a transformer-based model is proportional to the number of *transformer layers* √ó *hidden dimensions* √ó *sequence length* √ó *batch size*. 

[**Activation checkpointing**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06174) (or gradient checkpointing) is a common approach to reduce the activation memory by approximately the square root of the total activations at the expense of 33% re-computation overhead. This would reduce the activation memory consumption of this model from 60 GB to about 8 GB. 

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/BsRo4b2J31zUFr-KMcs_n.png)

![image/gif](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/ThPtDpjoHZ0GLBsRBfxAR.gif)

Despite the significant reduction, the activation memory can grow quite large for bigger models even with activation checkpointing. For example, a GPT-like model with 100 billion parameters requires around 60 GB of memory for batch size 32, even when using activation checkpointing.

**Temporary buffers** used for storing intermediate results consumes non-trivial amount of memory for large models. Operations such as gradient all-reduce, or gradient norm computation tend to fuse all the gradients into a single flattened buffer before applying the operation in an effort to improve throughput. For example, the bandwidth of all-reduce across devices improves with large message sizes. While the gradient themselves are usually stored as fp16 tensors, the fused buffer can be an fp32 tensor depending on the operation. When the size of the model is large, these temporary buffer sizes are non-trivial. For example, for a model with 1.5B parameters, a flattened fp32 buffer would required 6 GB of memory

**Memory Fragmentation**: So far we have discussed the actual memory consumption during training. Additionally, it is possible to run out of usable memory even when there is plenty of available memory. This can happen with memory fragmentation. A request for a memory will fail if there isn‚Äôt enough contiguous memory to satisfy it, even if the total available memory is larger than requested. We observe significant memory fragmentation when training very large models, resulting in out of memory issue with over 30% of memory still available in some extreme cases.

## 2. Quantization
Quantization in deep learning is the process of reducing the precision of the numbers used to represent a model's parameters (weights) and computations, typically from 32-bit floating-point (FP32) to lower bit-width formats like 16-bit floating-point (FP16), 8-bit integers (INT8), or even lower. The main goal of quantization is to decrease the model's size, reduce memory usage, and accelerate inference by enabling the model to run efficiently on hardware with limited computational resources.

In general, it is not possible to perform pure 4bit/8bit training on quantized models. However, you can train these models by leveraging parameter efficient fine tuning methods (PEFT) and train for example adapters on top of them. We'll dive into this approach in the next section

The simplest form of "quantization" is to convert parameters from fp32 to fp16. During training, the main weights are always stored in FP32, but in practice, the half-precision weights often provide similar quality during inference as their fp32 counterpart - a precise reference of the model is only needed when it receives multiple gradient updates. This means we can use the half-precision weights and use half the GPUs to accomplish the same outcome.

It'd be amazing to cut precision further, but the inference quality outcome starts to drop dramatically at lower precision. That's why we need trickier ways to do it.

Quantization is done by essentially ‚Äúrounding‚Äù from one data type to another. For example, if one data type has the range 0..9 and another 0..4, then the value ‚Äú4‚Äù in the first data type would be rounded to ‚Äú2‚Äù in the second data type. However, if we have the value ‚Äú3‚Äù in the first data type, it lies between 1 and 2 of the second data type, then we would usually round to ‚Äú2‚Äù. This shows that both values ‚Äú4‚Äù and ‚Äú3‚Äù of the first data type have the same value ‚Äú2‚Äù in the second data type. This highlights that quantization is a noisy process that can lead to information loss, a sort of lossy compression.

### 2.1 Asymmetric and Symmetric Linear Quantization
Let‚Äôs start with the illustrations:

**Asymmetric**:
![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/E1qaUh4uRmMXMfmxPlSiu.png)

**Symmetric**:
![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/QMMum7lBhmZlPj-BCANn8.png)

In essence, we're mapping a continuous range of real numbers into an integer range. The process can be visualized as follows:

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/JwT-g6-J31Hce_xylvAxD.png)

Here, **S** and **Z** are the quantization parameters, calculated during the quantization process. **S** (scale) determines the transformation's scale, and **Z** (zero point) corresponds to the zero value in the quantized domain.
- **–ù–µ—Å–∏–º–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏—á–Ω–∞—è**
  - \\(S = \frac {r_{max}-r_ {min}}{q_{max}-q_{min}} \\)
  - \\(Z = \left[q_{min} - \frac{r_{min}}{S}\right]\\)
  - \\(X_{quantized} = \left[\frac{X}{S} + Z\right]\\)
  - \\(X_{dequantized} = S(X_{quantized} - Z)\\)

- **–°–∏–º–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏—á–Ω–∞—è**
  - The quantization range is determined by the maximum absolute value of the data.
  - \\(S = \frac{|r|_{max}}{2^{N-1} - 1} \\)
  - \\(Z = 0\\)
  - \\(X_{quantized} = \left[\frac{X}{S}\right]\\)
  - \\(X_{dequantized} = SX_{quantized}\\)
  - To maintain symmetry, one value is typically removed from the quantized data type. For example, the signed int8 range of [-128, 127] becomes [-127, 127].

where \\([  ]\\) denotes rounding.

The advantage of asymmetric quantization is its ability to better handle asymmetric data distributions, whereas symmetric quantization benefits from simplicity and speed. With symmetric quantization, there's no need to store a zero-point, and dequantization is a simple multiplication by a constant.

Example:

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/6qS8qC8WTNdZFcnV16ufS.png)

The result is an 8-bit integer tensor with a quantization constant of 23.5. This allows for reduced storage requirements and, if necessary, conversion back to the original 32-bit floating-point representation, albeit with some loss of precision.

### 2.2 What to Quantize?

The standard approach is to quantize the model's weights. This requires no additional manipulations‚Äîjust apply the formulas.

You can also quantize the outputs of layers, known as activations. To do this, you need to estimate the range of values that appear in activation tensors. This is done by running data from the training dataset through the trained neural network and collecting statistics. Using this information, you determine the quantization parameters. This method is called static quantization.

In dynamic quantization, activations are quantized during inference. This approach can yield better quality, but it introduces challenges: finding the quantization parameters dynamically during inference makes the method more complex and computationally expensive, though it ensures the parameters are always up-to-date.

### 2.3 When to Quantize?

Preparing a network for quantization can be done during training, known as **Quantize-Aware Training**. In this approach, special blocks are embedded in the neural network, and quantized inference is simulated during training.

Quantize-Aware Training is complex and requires more computational resources, but it produces a model that is "adapted" to working with quantized values, potentially offering higher accuracy.

In the **Post Training Quantization** method, an already trained model is quantized. For activation quantization, you pass data from a calibration dataset through the trained network, collect tensor statistics, and then quantize. If you‚Äôre only quantizing weights, no additional data is needed since all necessary information is already in the tensors. This method is simpler and faster than Quantize-Aware Training but is typically less accurate.

### 2.4 Granularity

Quantization can be applied with varying levels of granularity. The most basic approach is to quantize the entire network at once, resulting in a single scale factor S for the entire model. This often leads to unsatisfactory results.

A better approach is to quantize tensors individually, allowing each tensor to have its own scale factor. You can go even further and quantize rows or columns within each tensor, giving each row (or column) its own scale factor. Although this increases the storage requirements for scale factors, it significantly improves the accuracy of computations.

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/xbY-NhjLaCY88RPi5PNee.png)

You can also divide the tensor into smaller blocks, which yields even greater accuracy. This approach helps mitigate the impact of outliers in matrices, a topic we'll explore further.

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/S1SvT4tE5OEVvTskumu3c.png)

In summary, the smaller the granularity, the fewer scale factors you need to store; conversely, the higher the granularity, the closer the quantized computations are to the original.

### 2.5 Data Types

Quantized neural network models typically involve two types of data:

- **Quantized type** ‚Äî  the type used to store tensors.
- **Computation type** ‚Äî the type used for performing calculations.

Unfortunately, these two types don't always match. For example, your hardware might not support operations in a specific quantized type. Efficient matrix multiplication kernels for certain quantized types may not exist. In such cases, you‚Äôll need to convert the matrix to a computation type before performing calculations. The computation type also helps avoid overflow issues in activations since multiplying 8-bit numbers can easily exceed the data type's limits.

### 2.6 The Problem of Outliers
Consider the example of symmetric quantization:

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/AHIUqmayD-GX7PpEPirpg.png)

What happens if an outlier is present in the input tensor?

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/M-NJYW1SuSDNU4qiHa5Dv.png)

The weights get "compressed" into a narrow range, becoming indistinguishable. The model's quality is compromised. In this case, a single outlier ruined the entire matrix.

As the number of parameters increases, standard quantization techniques begin to fail. When the number of parameters exceeds 6.7 billion, quantized models [lose significant quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339). This occurs due to the increasing number of outliers in the matrices.

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/juzSha_nIdR3znammiwgO.png)









#### 1.2. PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
PEFT is a family of methods designed to efficiently adapt large-scale models by training only a small subset of parameters. These methods significantly reduce computational costs and memory requirements while maintaining quality comparable to full fine-tuning.

One of the most popular and effective PEFT methods is [LoRa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685).

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/Q0d07jIXg43H4IAEgAJJN.png)

To understand the illustration, let's delve into the fundamental observation that makes this method effective:
>A neural network contains many dense layers which perform matrix multiplication. The weight
matrices in these layers typically have full-rank. When adapting to a specific task, Aghajanyan et al.
(2020) shows that the pre-trained language models have a low ‚Äúinstrisic dimension‚Äù and can still
learn efficiently despite a random projection to a smaller subspace

This means that while training for a broad, complex task, the weight matrices in a neural network have full rank, which minimizes redundancy. However, when fine-tuning this universal model for a specialized task, not all the knowledge from the original model is necessary. Therefore, only a small fraction of the parameters needs to be trained. In simpler terms, the weight matrices can be represented by smaller matrices with fewer parameters. Thus, during full fine-tuning, the weight matrices can be considered low-rank, indicating that full fine-tuning involves some degree of redundancy.

>Inspired by this, we hypothesize the updates to the weights also have a low ‚Äúintrinsic rank‚Äù during adaptation.

Given that low-rank weight matrices suffice for full fine-tuning on a downstream task, it's reasonable to assume that the gradient updates themselves can be represented by low-rank matrices. 

>For a pre-trained weight matrix \\(W_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\\), we constrain its update by representing the latter with a low-rank decomposition \\(W_0 + \Delta W = W_0 + BA\\), where \\(B \in \mathbb{R}^{d\times r}\\), \\(A \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times k}\\), and the rank \\(r \ll d\\). During training, \\(W_0\\) is frozen and does not receive gradient updates, while \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) contain trainable parameters. Note both \\(W_0\\) and \\(\Delta W = BA\\) are multiplied with the same input, and their respective output vectors are summed coordinate-wise. For \\(h = W_0x\\) our modified forward pass yields:
$$ h = W_0x + \Delta W x = W_0x + BAx $$

In essence, we freeze the original model, insert low-rank adapters under the relevant weight matrices, and train these adapters to simulate the updates that would normally come from gradients. With these concepts and the formulas above, you should now understand the illustration provided.

Where do the memory and computation optimizations come from? Since the baseline model is frozen, we don‚Äôt store gradients or optimizer moments for it, and we avoid unnecessary computations. Essentially, with a few caveats, we now only need to perform inference on the baseline model, which, in the case of large models, still requires significant hardware resources. However, the trainable parameters in these adapters typically constitute less than 1% of the total parameters of the original model.

#### 1.3. Quantization –∏ QLoRa

You might wonder, "*Since fp16 works so well, can we reduce the precision of the numbers even further‚Äîto 8 bits or even 4?*" This is the essence of quantization. However, simply downcasting to 8 or 4 bits would make the computations highly unstable, especially during training.

Quantization aims to reduce memory usage with minimal loss of accuracy. While many types of quantization exist, I'll focus on the most basic and commonly used method.

Generally, quantization is applied only during inference because training with such low-precision numbers is highly unstable. However, it's possible to train adapters on top of a quantized model ‚Äî a concept I'll explore later.

So, how does basic quantization work? Let's take a look at the figure:

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/zI_ZTgUutnP1YW70r5D2q.png)

In simple terms, we linearly scale the parameters in the matrices from fp32 to int8 (or int4), while keeping the constants needed for reverse dequantization. This allows us to create a highly compressed model with significantly reduced memory requirements.

During inference, as the computation moves through the layers, the required parameters are dequantized, the necessary computations are performed (e.g., in fp16), and then the parameters are re-quantized before moving to the next layer.
I am simplifying things a lot, because the analysis of quantization techniques can be a separate article, but I think you have understood the main idea.

And it turns out that after such quantization, the quality of language models on inference drops quite insignificantly. This is also due to the fact that in language modeling we do not care so much about exact probabilities in predicting the next token. Basically, we just sample from the dictionary distribution predicted by the model

You might ask, "*Can this idea be applied to training?*" While training directly on a quantized model is not feasible, training adapters on top of a quantized model is possible, which is the basis of the brilliant [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) 

That is, there will only be a small change in the illustration about LoRa:

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/eJkmp305QaBin8vtzJf77.png)

Let‚Äôs delve deeper into the QLoRa method:

First, a bit more about quantization:
>**Block-wise k-bit Quantization.** Quantization is the process of discretizing an input from a representation that holds more information to a representation with less information. It often means taking a data type with more bits and converting it to fewer bits, for example from 32-bit floats to 8-bit Integers. To ensure that the entire range of the low-bit data type is used, the input data type is commonly rescaled into the target data type range through normalization by the absolute maximum
of the input elements, which are usually structured as a tensor. For example, quantizing a 32-bit Floating Point (FP32) tensor into a Int8 tensor with range [‚àí127, 127]:
$$ \mathbf{X}^{\text{Int8}} = \text{round}\left(\frac{127}{\text{absmax}(\mathbf{X}^{\text{FP32}})} \mathbf{X}^{\text{FP32}}\right) = \text{round}(c^{\text{FP32}} \cdot \mathbf{X}^{\text{FP32}}),$$
where c is the *quantization constant* or *quantization scale*. Dequantization is the inverse:
$$ \text{dequant}(c^{\text{FP32}}, \mathbf{X}^{\text{Int8}}) = \frac{\mathbf{X}^{\text{Int8}}}{c^{\text{FP32}}} = \mathbf{X}^{\text{FP32}} $$
The problem with this approach is that if a large magnitude value (i.e., an outlier) occurs in the input tensor, then the quantization bins‚Äîcertain bit combinations‚Äîare not utilized well with few or no numbers quantized in some bins. To prevent the outlier issue, a common approach is to chunk the input tensor into blocks that are independently quantized, each with their own quantization constant c. This can be formalized as follows: We chunk the input tensor \\(\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{b \times h}\\) into n contiguous blocks of size B by flattening the input tensor and slicing the linear segment into \\(n = (b \times h) / B\\) blocks. We quantize these blocks independently with Equation 1 to create a quantized tensor and n quantization constants \\(c_i\\)

The Block-wise method for outlier avoidance is worth noting here.

The QLoRA authors also proposed two valuable techniques:
- **Double Quantization**: Here, even the quantization constants *c* are quantized, further saving memory.
- **4-bit NormalFloat**: Leveraging the fact that pretrained neural network weights typically have a zero-centered normal distribution, this technique allows for a more informative mapping from fp32 to int4, with higher precision near zero.

![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/qWvY2qGfbZfOGr8T_rewn.png)

Now, let‚Äôs understand the entire QLoRA process (L1 and L2 in the formulas correspond to B and A in the figure):
> **QLoRA**. Using the components described above, we define QLORA for a single linear layer in the quantized base model with a single LoRA adapter as follows:
$$ \mathbf{Y}^{\text{BF16}} = \mathbf{X}^{\text{BF16}} \text{doubleDequant}(c_1^{\text{FP32}}, c_2^{k\text{-bit}}, \mathbf{W}^{\text{NF4}}) + \mathbf{X}^{\text{BF16}} \mathbf{L}_1^{\text{BF16}} \mathbf{L}_2^{\text{BF16}} $$
where doubleDequant(¬∑) is defined as:
$$ \text{doubleDequant}(c_1^{\text{FP32}}, c_2^{k\text{-bit}}, \mathbf{W}^{k\text{-bit}}) = \text{dequant}(\text{dequant}(c_1^{\text{FP32}}, c_2^{k\text{-bit}}), \mathbf{W}^{4\text{bit}}) = \mathbf{W}^{\text{BF16}} $$
We use NF4 for \\(\mathbf{W}\\) and FP8 for \\(c_2\\). We use a blocksize of 64 for \\(\mathbf{W}\\) for higher quantization precision and a blocksize of 256 for \\(c_2\\) to conserve memory.

>To summarize, QLORA has one storage data type (usually 4-bit NormalFloat) and a computation data type (16-bit BrainFloat). We dequantize the storage data type to the computation data type to perform the forward and backward pass, but we only compute weight gradients for the LoRA parameters which use 16-bit BrainFloat.

Let‚Äôs calculate the memory requirements for a model like Llama 70B using QLoRa: 
1. Quantizing the model to 4-bit reduces the size to 65GB.
2. Adding LoRa adapters, which, let's say, occupy about 0.25% of the original model‚Äôs parameters (175 million parameters), and training these in Mixed Precision requires approximately 2.6GB (175M * 16 bytes).
3. Of course, activations for such a large model will still require significant memory, but we'll soon discuss how gradient checkpointing can help mitigate this.

In summary, we‚Äôve reduced the memory requirement from 1040GB to 68GB! (Using LoRa without quantization, the frozen base model in 16-bit would take 260GB, plus the same 2.6GB for training adapters).

#### 1.4. Gradient Checkpointing

Get ready for some cool visualizations!

First, let's examine the computational graph for the forward and backward passes. Don't worry if it looks complex at first‚Äîthere are simpler animations below that will make everything clear.

You might be wondering, what exactly are the "scary activations" we mentioned earlier? Let's break down what we aim to achieve in the learning process:
1. Our goal is to improve the model, i.e., to reduce the error.
2. We reduce this error by adjusting the model's weights.
3. To adjust the weights, we need to calculate the gradient of the error function with respect to these weights.
4. We achieve this by using the chain rule to propagate the gradient from the error back through the network to the weights during the backward pass.
5. To do this, we at least need the error value itself.
6. This means we first need to perform a forward pass‚Äîrunning the input data through the entire model to generate a prediction.
7. Most critically, to compute the gradients, we need to account for all the intermediate computations and the dependent terms involved in generating the prediction. These are the activations that we store in memory from the entire forward pass so we can use them during the backward pass (represented by the gray and black sections in the picture).

This process can be schematically represented as follows:

![image/gif](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/SwMyFsZSETbZeksAa5bCO.gif)

Now, let's think about how we can reduce memory consumption. One idea might be to recalculate each activation during the backward pass only when we need it:

![image/gif](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/660710b03ef451aa2bab8971/mHYCcFuL2Bjcm774X4rVa.gif)

However, this approach leads to too many recalculations, which negatively impacts training time. This is a classic example of the Time-Memory Trade-Off in programming.
So, what's a good compromise? Here's a solution:
1. Select several "checkpoints" along the path of the forward pass and save only those.
2. During the backward pass, instead of recalculating all activations from the start, we only need to recalculate starting from the nearest checkpoint to the left.

This method significantly reduces memory consumption, though it does come at the cost of increased training time.

#### 1.5. Flash Attention

Scaling the transformer architecture is heavily bottlenecked by the self-attention mechanism, which has quadratic time and memory complexity. Recent developments in accelerator hardware mainly focus on enhancing compute capacities and not memory and transferring data between hardware. This results in attention operation having a memory bottleneck.

Standard attention mechanism uses High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to store, read and write keys, queries and values. HBM is large in memory, but slow in processing, meanwhile SRAM is smaller in memory, but faster in operations. In the standard attention implementation, the cost of loading and writing keys, queries, and values from HBM is high. It loads keys, queries, and values from HBM to GPU on-chip SRAM, performs a single step of the attention mechanism, writes it back to HBM, and repeats this for every single attention step.

[**FlashAttention**](https://tridao.me/publications/flash3/flash3.pdf) is an algorithm that reorders the attention computation and leverages tiling and recomputation to significantly speed it up and reduce memory usage from quadratic to linear in sequence length. It uses tiling to load blocks of inputs from HBM (GPU memory) to SRAM (fast cache), perform attention with respect to that block, and update the output in HBM. By not writing the large intermediate attention matrices to HBM, we reduce the amount of memory reads/writes, which brings 2-4x wallclock time speedup.

Diagram of FlashAttention forward pass: with tiling and softmax rescaling, we operate by blocks and avoid having to read/write from HBM, while obtaining the correct output with no approximation.

We have come a long way. Of the hard stuff, only one topic remains to be dealt with - distributed computing. Before them, let's briefly discuss a few more small methods that can slightly improve your performance

#### 1.6. Gradient Accumulation

**Gradient accumulation** is a technique where you can train on bigger batch sizes than your machine would normally be able to fit into memory. This is done by accumulating gradients over several batches, and only stepping the optimizer after a certain number of batches have been performed.

For instance, if the gradient accumulation factor is set to 2, the process works as follows: We first calculate the gradient on one batch, which gives us a direction on the [loss function landscape](https://losslandscape.com/). Instead of updating the model weights immediately, we calculate another gradient from the next batch, obtaining a potentially different direction. By adding these two gradients together, we find a more accurate path in the loss landscape. To ensure the final update step is properly scaled, we divide the accumulated gradient by the number of batches, preventing any artificial inflation of the step size.

This technique is particularly useful when only small batch sizes can fit into memory, which might otherwise lead to overly noisy updates and less stable training.
